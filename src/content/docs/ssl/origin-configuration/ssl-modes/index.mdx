If possible, Cloudflare strongly recommends using [**Full**](/ssl/origin-configuration/ssl-modes/full/) or [**Full (strict)**](/ssl/origin-configuration/ssl-modes/full-strict/) modes to prevent malicious connections to your origin.

For more details on how encryption modes fit into the bigger picture of Cloudflare SSL/TLS protection, refer to [Concepts](/ssl/concepts/#ssltls-certificate).

## Available encryption modes

:::note
We are gradually rolling out the new [Automated SSL/TLS feature](#automatic-ssltls-default).

If your zone has not been migrated yet, you will only have [Custom SSL/TLS](#custom-ssltls) options in your dashboard.

### Automatic SSL/TLS (default)

Automatic SSL/TLS uses the [SSL/TLS Recommender](/ssl/origin-configuration/ssl-tls-recommender/) to identify and apply the most secure encryption mode for your website. It continuously assesses your traffic to determine if a more secure option is needed based on your origin certification or capabilities, and updates your settings automatically to ensure the highest level of security for your domain.

#### Opt out

If you want to opt a zone out via the API, you can make this API call on or before the grace period expiration date (September 16, 2024).

```bash
 curl --request PATCH \
  --url https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/<ZONE_ID>/settings/ssl_automatic_mode \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <CF_API_TOKEN>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{"value":"custom"}'
```

If you have multiple zones, you may want to opt them all out via automation:

1. Create a list of

### Custom SSL/TLS

To use Custom SSL/TLS, select the custom option (if you prefer to manually set the encryption mode instead of using [Automatic SSL/TLS](#automatic-ssltls-default)):
